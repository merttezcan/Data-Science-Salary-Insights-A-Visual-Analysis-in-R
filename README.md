# Data Science Salary Insights: A Visual Analysis in R

## 1. Introduction
This project aimed to analyze the salary data of data scientists around the world. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from a global online platform for data science professionals. It contains information on job titles, company location, company size, employment type, industry, experience level, and salary.

## 2. Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing the format of certain variables. This helped to ensure that the data used for analysis was accurate and consistent.

## 3. Data Analysis
The analysis revealed that the United States had the highest number of data scientists (at least in our dataset), and that the average salary in the field was around $120,000. It also showed that there is a positive correlation between GDP per capita and average salary. The data also revealed that while the majority of data scientists have full-time employment, a small proportion are employed on a contract or freelance basis.

## 4. Data Visualization
Data visualization was used to explore the characteristics of the data science job salaries in the dataset. Visualizations included the distribution of experience levels, common job titles, and countries with the highest number of data scientists, relationship between salary and GDP per capita, prevalence of remote work, relationship between salary and company size, proportion of experience level within top job titles, and salary distribution by industry. These visualizations provided insights into the trends and patterns in the data, and helped us understand the factors that influence data science salaries.

## 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this project helped to gain a deeper understanding of the data science job market and the factors that influence data science salaries. It also provided valuable insights that can be useful for data scientists looking to negotiate their salaries or for employers looking to attract and retain top talent. However, the result must be taken with a grain of salt, as it only represents a small group of people in our dataset, so it would be wrong to generalize.
